an object of class "SDMX"

\describe{
\item{\code{xmlObj}}{Object of class "XMLInternalDocument" derived from XML package}

\item{\code{schema}}{Object of class "SDMXSchema", handles the version of SDMX-ML format}

\item{\code{header}}{Object of class "SDMXHeader", handles the SDMX-ML document header}

\item{\code{footer}}{Object of class "SDMXFooter", handles the SDMX-ML document footer}
}}
\note{
Currently, the approach drafted in \link{rsdmx} package was to rely on XML
 package, read the xml object and store it as part of the SDMX R object. Another
 approach being investigated is to use XML handlers throughthe Simple API for XML
 (SAX) that could avoid to load the full XML tree in the SDMX R object (xmlObj).
 Indeed, SDMX data could be huge and causes issues of memory if the complete XML
 tree is loaded in the R user session.

\section{Warning}{

This class is not useful in itself, but all SDMX classes in this package derive
from it.
